Notes for Teacher:
I finished everything. It took 3 full weeks for me. The only thing that's left is changing Sprites.

Because when i did bullet and wall collision it causes bug, when enemy is closely touching wall, you can not kill it, so you need to push it a little bit.
 But if you remove bullet and wall collision everything is perfect 
 
It took for me a lot of time to draw only how sprite goes down. But i did not put it in because it was only one way.(called sketch in images package)
I also download another sprite (PlayerSprite) but i did not have sprite where it is shooting, so i just commented it
